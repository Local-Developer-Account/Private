Make me a new GUI where it displays a loading screen and after loading is done make in the center of the screen say Loading Interface.. And then at the top middle have a bar come down with tabs that are colored and on the bottom middle I want a info bar where it is nice and displays current date, time, week, and status. Make sure the time is 00:00:00 and the date is month, day, year, week, etc and also make changes to this code for me after that add all of the functions in the new gui with buttons, descriptions, and more also make a small button on the left middle of the screen that hides and opens the new interface. Also it should be nice, and transparent.
